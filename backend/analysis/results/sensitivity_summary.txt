==============================================================================

OVERVIEW
--------------------------------------------------
  This report summarizes sensitivity analyses across three dimensions:
  1. Interest rate:  i = 2% to 8% (Mexico, projected year 2029)
  2. Mortality shock: q_x x 0.70 to 1.30 (Mexico, i=5%)
  3. Cross-country:  Mexico vs USA vs Spain (1990-2019)

A. INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY (Mexico)
--------------------------------------------------
  Whole life premium at age 40:
    i=2%: $      17,910
    i=5%: $      10,765  (base)
    i=8%: $       7,014
    Range: +101% spread around base

  Most interest-rate sensitive product: whole life
  (101% spread from i=2% to i=8% at age 40)

B. MORTALITY SHOCK SENSITIVITY (Mexico)
--------------------------------------------------
  Whole life premium at age 40 (i=5%):
    0.70x (30% improvement): $       8,807  (-18.2%)
    1.00x (base):            $      10,765
    1.30x (30% deterioration): $      12,506  (+16.2%)


C. CROSS-COUNTRY COMPARISON
--------------------------------------------------
  Lee-Carter drift (mortality improvement speed):
      Mexico: -1.0764
         USA: -1.1920
       Spain: -2.8949

  Whole life premium at age 40 (i=5%):
      Mexico: $      10,765
         USA: $      10,178
       Spain: $       8,191

  Lee-Carter model fit:
      Mexico: explained variance = 77.7%
         USA: explained variance = 86.7%
       Spain: explained variance = 94.8%

D. KEY TAKEAWAYS
--------------------------------------------------
  1. Interest rate is the DOMINANT sensitivity factor for long-duration
     products (whole life, endowment). A 3% rate change can shift
     premiums by 30-60%.

  2. Mortality shocks have a SMALLER but ASYMMETRIC effect. A 30%
     mortality deterioration hurts more than a 30% improvement helps.
     This justifies regulatory capital buffers.

  3. Cross-country comparison shows that while all three countries
     exhibit improving mortality, the SPEED and LEVEL differ. Mexico's
     base mortality profile differs from developed-country HMD patterns,
     reinforcing the need for country-specific calibration.

  4. For CNSF regulatory compliance, stress testing should combine
     interest rate AND mortality shocks simultaneously (joint stress),
     as these risks can correlate during economic crises.
